*TL;DR: Bing query rewriting is completely absurd.*

I rarely use [Bing](http://bing.com), but now I have to do it from time to time for SEO purposes.
It was a completely WTF moment when [I queried it for "Chivalo"](http://www.bing.com/search?q=chivalo).
See the results for Bing in Spanish:

1. Ch - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre - es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch
2. Carolina Herrera - www.carolinaherrera.com
3. .ch - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre - es.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ch

What? No result contains the keyword *chivalo* in the title, URL, snippet or content. **The query has been
rewritten from *chivalo* to just *ch*.**

Let's try for *chívalo* (note the *í* which is the correct spelling for the Spanish word)...

1. Ferdinand Cheval - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre - es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand\_Cheval
2. Château Cheval Blanc - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre - es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Château\_Cheval\_Blanc
3. Cheval - Wikipédia - fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheval

Alright. *chívalo* is rewritten to *cheval*. Two different words from two different languages (Spanish and French)
with no relation at all.

Let's try Bing UK:

1. George Chuvalo - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_Chuvalo
2. Chivalo - Discover, collect, buy - chivalo.com
3. George Chuvalo - IMDb - www.imdb.com/name/nm0161546

Hey. Our website appears as the second result. But no other related results are shown, and completely unrelated
results for *Chuvalo* are included. At least, in this case, I get a message explaining what's happening
(*Including results for chuvalo. Do you want results for chivalo only?*) which was not the case for Bing in
Spanish.

**To the Bing guys: Chivalo can be a few things:**

1. A Spanish word (*chívalo*) for *gossip it*. It's quite unusual, but it's a form of the verb *chivar*.
2. A Spanish family name.
3. **[Chivalo.com](http://chivalo.com) (my startup)**
4. [A small village in Mozambique.](https://www.google.es/maps/preview#!q=-24.1958333+%2C34.5416667&data=!1m4!1m3!1d3128!2d34.5396333!3d-24.1961326!2m1!1e3!4m14!2m13!1m12!3m8!1m3!1d6262!2d34.7289204!3d-24.0622766!3m2!1i1364!2i660!4f13.1!4m2!3d-24.1958333!4d34.5416667&fid=7) It's not recognized by Google Maps, but it's there.
5. <a href="http://www.chivalo.nl/" rel="nofollow">A small dutch store.</a>
6. A few more things that are barely findable.

**None of them have any relation with *CH*, *Chuvalo* or *cheval*, at all. You are trying to be too smart, and you look dumb instead.**

For search results that make sense, try [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chivalo) or [Google](https://www.google.es/#q=chivalo).
