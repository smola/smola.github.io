Vodafone Spain is deploying a web blocking system dubbed Castor. This is the first time that a Spanish ISP has taken the web blocking beyond the DNS level: they're performing large-scale [Man-in-the-Middle attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), intercepting HTTP requests to some website's IPs and serving an HTML redirect to their blocking system instead.

Here's a compilation of the sites blocked by Vodafone Spain.
